# The Soundtrack of Exam Stress
I am Efe Keskiner(31079), this is my DSA 210 project:

# Project Overview 

This project explores the relationship between music listening habits and exam periods. Using my personal Spotify data, the analysis aims to uncover trends in music preferences, listening patterns, and audio features during high-stress academic times. The project focuses on understanding how music influences or reflects productivity, focus, and relaxation during exam preparation.

# Motivation 
Exam periods often bring stress and increased focus requirements, making music a valuable companion for studying and stress relief. By analyzing my own data, I hope to:

 * Identify music trends during exam periods compared to non-exam times.
 * Discover how music genres, tempos, and moods correlate with focus and relaxation.
 * Gain insights into the role music plays in my academic routine.

# Data Source 

The data for this project is sourced from my personal Spotify account using:

 * Spotify API: For retrieving detailed information about songs, playlists, and listening history.
 * MySu: Doin an excel file for my exam period based on MySu.

# Data Analysis 

1. Data Preparation:

 * Extract Spotify listening history using the Spotify API.
 * Filter data based on MySu to isolate exam periods.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

 * Analyze genres, artists, and top tracks during exam periods.
 * Compare listening duration and frequency between exam and non-exam periods.

3. Audio Feature Analysis:

 * Use Spotify's audio features (e.g., energy, tempo, valence) to classify songs as calming or energizing.
 * Identify shifts in preferences during exam times.

4. Visualization:

 * Create visual representations of trends, including genre distributions, mood transitions, and listening peaks.

5. Clustering and Correlation:

 * Group songs into clusters (e.g., "study-focus" vs. "stress-relief") using clustering algorithms.
 * Explore potential correlations between music and productivity patterns.

# Findings 

 * Key insights about my listening habits during exams.
 * Trends in music genres, moods, and features for focus and relaxation.
 * Visualization of differences before, during, and after exam periods.

# Limitations and Future Work

* Limitations:
   * Data is limited to my Spotify history and may not generalize to others.
   * Dependence on MySU schedules may not capture unscheduled or informal study sessions.
* Future Work:
   * Extend the analysis to include more exam periods.
   * Experiment with predictive models for identifying potential "study songs."
